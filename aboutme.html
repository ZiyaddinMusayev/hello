        <p>Hi, my name is Ziyaddin, I'm 14 years old, and I'm a student from Azerbaijan.
          I enjoy coding websites, mostly websites that can be always helpful to people.
          My purpose in coding a website is to be good at coding and to inspire people to work,
          not to social media or bad habits. You can use this website to read Quran, to check the
          Pray times and if you don't know how to pray, then you can learn it here. I will add new
          features to the website regularly, If I cancel calls then know that I'm studying :).
          PS. If you want to advertise your (Business, product ....) here then you may contact me through Instagram, Gmail, or WhatsApp.</p>
